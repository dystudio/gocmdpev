## Usage

```
go get -u github.com/simon-engledew/gocmdpev
```

or via Homebrew:

```
brew tap simon-engledew/gocmdpev
brew install gocmdpev
```

Generate a query plan with all the trimmings by prefixing your query with:

```pgsql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, COSTS, VERBOSE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON)
```

Then pipe the resulting query plan into `gocmdpev`.

On MacOS you can just grab a query on your clipboard and run this one-liner:

```bash
pbpaste | sed '1s/^/EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, COSTS, VERBOSE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) /' | psql -qXAt <DATABASE> | gocmdpev
```

## Python 3 Bindings

Check out the repository and run `make python3` to build and test the bindings.

## Using with Ruby on Rails

Try the [`pg-eyeballs`](https://github.com/bradurani/pg-eyeballs) gem
